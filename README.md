Mathematical implementation and extension of mathematical model for the dynamics and control of malaria in Nigeria.
The paper we are recreating and extending: [A Mathematical Model  for the Dynamics and Control of Malaria in  Nigeria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9661649/) by O.C. Collins and K.J. Duffy. 

This project was completed as part of the Dynamics of Biological Systems: A Quantitative Introduction to Biology (BIOL 300) class at Case Western Reserve University.
This project involves a Mathematica notebook with code for the model/extension and a paper describing the background, approach and extension.

I wanted to include this extensive project on GitHub to share the logic and Mathematica code necessary for reproducing and extending this complex mathematical analysis.

## Mathematica Notebook

The notebook with all Mathematica code for reproducing figures from paper and extension is available in pdf form at [mathematica-notebook.pdf](mathematica-notebook.pdf).

## Final Paper

The paper describing the background, approach and extensio is available in pdf form at [final-paper.pdf](final-paper.pdf).
